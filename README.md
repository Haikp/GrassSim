What will be attempted in this project:
- Make a nice grass field scenery
  - Use more advanced lighting techniques
- Use multiple shaders
  - I want to create a arch or a doorway, that when looking through the door uses a different shader
    - The scene will remain the exact same, its just that the shader is different
    - if the camera goes through the door, then the main shader should be the one we see
      - maybe make your own lighting textures?

Conceptual math required that I haven't learned yet after brainstorming:
- determine whether or not the pixel being rendered is seen through the doorway
- determine if the camera itself has passed through the doorway
- make the grass itself sway
  - something about perlin noise and sine waves I believe
- height map implementation

3/20/25 Update:
So after starting this small project, I have a bunch of ideas I want to try and implement, but after taking the time to do some research, I realize that a lot of things I'm trying to do, LearnOpenGL modules already do cover to some extent. I wanted this project to be something that I allow my self to take break from following modules to explore on my own, but I can see that perhaps its best to follow the modules a bit longer. I could skip straight to height maps, but the chunks of knowledge between where I am currently, and the chapter on height maps, I feel like is probably important. I feel like at my level, there are still steps that I need to take before being able to branch out on my own. I don't think its a good idea to skip geometry shaders or just glance over tessellation shaders, so I continue doing things sequentially. I'll be back to this project soon.
