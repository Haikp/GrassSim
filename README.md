What will be attempted in this project:
- Make a nice grass field scenery
  - Use more advanced lighting techniques
- Use multiple shaders
  - I want to create a arch or a doorway, that when looking through the door uses a different shader
    - The scene will remain the exact same, its just that the shader is different
    - if the camera goes through the door, then the main shader should be the one we see
      - maybe make your own lighting textures?

Conceptual math required that I haven't learned yet after brainstorming:
- determine whether or not the pixel being rendered is seen through the doorway
- determine if the camera itself has passed through the doorway
- make the grass itself sway
  - something about perlin noise and sine waves I believe
